A review of geologic mapping by Dibblee (1967a, b; Dibblee (1968) shows that the interpretation of the 9.6 km offset is problematic, as there are no well-defined piercing lines, or correlative deposits. The deposits (located south of the fault) are also moderately dipping (~20 degrees) and given the proximity to the fault, it is possible the unit Dibblee mapped is an offset fold.
